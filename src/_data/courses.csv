The study of the archaeology, artistic media, cosmovision, capital cities, human sacrifice, and the religious devotions of ancient Mesoamerica illuminate the Day of the Dead and Virgin of Guadalupe phenomena today. Objects at the Peabody Museum are used to examine new concepts of race, nation, and the persistence of Moctezuma's Mexico in Latino identities in the Mexico-US Borderlands.

Such self-identification, however, can obscure the complex and often contradictory ways in which we experience social class in our everyday lives. This course explores the cultural dimensions of social class in the US from an ethnographic perspective, focusing on the everyday lives and cultures of ordinary Americans. We consider questions such as the following: what is it like to be a working class person in a society heavily invested in ideas of individual advancement and meritocracy? How do professionals (the upper middle class) define themselves and how do they view those above and below them in the class structure? How does social class shape people's values, political views, and tastes? How are class boundaries created and maintained? The course readings are drawn mainly from anthropology and sociology.

Here Marx refers to the supposed power of capitalism to destroy pre-existing economic, social, and cultural orders. In the centuries since capitalism spread over the globe, it has indeed transformed the lifeways and cultures of peoples throughout the world. In more recent years, globalization understood as the widespread and accelerated movement of capital across national borders has radically altered the lives of many peoples, from peasants in China to industrial workers in Michigan. This course critically examines capitalism historically and ethnographically. In the first part of the course, we consider historical accounts of the origins, development, and transformation of American capitalism, focusing on the key themes of slavery, industrialization, and financialization. In the second part of the course, we consider ethnographic accounts of life under contemporary capitalism, focusing on the cultural responses of peoples experiencing the rapid social change, dislocation, opportunities, and hardships brought about by changing capitalist social relations. We consider questions such as how have people coped culturally with the demands of capitalist wage labor and work discipline? How have capitalist social relations transformed communities, families, and senses of ethnic and national identity?

Our goal is to develop, in collaboration with students, a pedagogy for fostering students' personal quests for wisdom, through lectures and readings, extensive conversation, and other experiences inside and outside of class, including dramaturgical experiences with film or theater, caregiving, and meditation. As teachers we are inspired by William James's conception of knowledge in the university as a strategy needed to live a life of purpose and significance that also contributes to improving the world. In the words of Albert Camus, ""Real generosity toward the future lies in giving all to the present."" Together, we engage with the problems of danger, uncertainty, failure, and suffering that led the founders of the social sciences and humanities to ask fundamental questions about meaning, imagination, aesthetics, social life, and subjective experience. These are the same existential questions that bring ordinary people all over the world, and throughout history, to question common sense reality in the face of catastrophes and the violence of everyday life. The many answers to these questions wisdom that is found in religious, ethical, and aesthetic quests, expressions, and traditions are intended to furnish individuals' art of living with strategies to respond to potential and hope, pain and suffering; to promote healing; and to address concerns about salvation, redemption, or other kinds of moral-emotional transformation. Together through discussions, lectures, films, virtual museum visits, readings, and action we explore different paths to wisdom, including the youthful quest for truth, beauty, and goodness; the affirmation of caregiving for others as the means of applying wisdom to repair and improve the world; suffering and the ordeal of journeying through labyrinths and tests of courage; the discovery of wisdom in teachers and mentors near and far; and the process of creative mourning for past losses and shaping new beginnings."

How does forced migration influence narration, creative expression, and imagination? What are the powers and potentials of artistic communication after existential rupture? What is the role of the storyteller in flight? This course explores expressive cultures in motion, amid crisis, and out of place, and asks how tradition bearers and creative innovators adapt when the communities in which their preexisting cultural practices had once flourished are destroyed, uprooted, transformed, or dispersed. It also asks how researchers, aid workers, activists, and other outsiders might engage in ethical and beneficial ways with individuals and communities in exile. In examining the impacts of forced migration on cultural production, transmission, and innovation, we put classical theories of refugee and migration studies in conversation with recent ethnographies and folklore collections, as well as memoirs, novels, songs, and films by and about displaced persons. With case studies ranging from colonial Africa, to post-war Europe, to contemporary America, we explore what, if anything, holds together the refugee experience, while also interrogating our own neighborly obligations and scholarly commitments as we navigate what has famously been deemed the century of the migrant."

That is, we seek to understand the economy not as a separate realm with its own special logic and structure but instead as embedded in the social relations, identities, and cultural practices of everyday life. Our major course themes include exchange, money, debt, commodification, markets, and labor. We consider questions such as, how do the different kinds of exchanges we engage in gift exchanges versus market exchanges, for instance shape our relationships with others? We explore the social meaning of money and the role of the market in our lives. In a world where it is possible to rent a family, does money destroy love and intimacy? What aspects of our lives are governed by the logic of capitalism and what aspects escape capitalism's grip? Why does it feel shameful to be in debt, and how has this shame been manipulated for political purposes? Why in the US do we consider work to be sacred and morally purifying even though many of us have tedious jobs? The course readings include theoretical and empirical works drawn mainly from the fields of anthropology, economic sociology, and heterodox economics. Our key texts include David Graeber's Debt, Viviana Zelizer's The Social Meaning of Money, and Sidney Mintz's Sweetness and Power."

Our spine-tingling intellectual task in this course is to analyze the roles that these malevolent entities and the supernatural narratives we tell about them play in our everyday lives, collective psyches, communities, and politics, and in the crises we confront as individuals and groups. Are our occult stories allegories of our modern discontents or simply holdovers from our childhood nightmares? Are they symptoms of specific societal crises or representations of timeless pan-human fears? How has the witch hunt, the rumor panic, the standardized nightmare of the group transformed in this meme-ified age of online participatory culture, global interconnection, ecological catastrophe, and fake-news-driven conspiracy thinking? What can we learn about ourselves, our pasts, and our futures by thinking deeply about what scares us the most? And how frightened should we be of what we might find if we dig too deeply into that question? We analyze the supernatural in relationship historical memories, cultural anxieties, folk traditions, spiritual beliefs, physiological sensations, political conflicts, environmental disasters, and existential imperatives. Because nowhere is safe from the things that go bump in the night, our interdisciplinary journey takes us across time and space into the bellies of various beasts, from the gates of Harvard Yard, to the hills of Rwanda, the message boards of 4chan, the proms of rural Pennsylvania, the ships of the Middle Passage, the villages of medieval Europe, the halls of the White House, your creepy neighbor's basement, and the deep dark woods.

Making matters worse, understanding the crisis in real time is notoriously difficult, especially since most who overdose do not go to hospitals and death certificates are often unreliable. And while everyone agrees something must be done, what that something is leads us into heated debates over health care spending and harm reduction. While most medical research focuses on the biology of disease, this course takes a biosocial approach to unmask how social factors, economic insecurity, and the availability of massive amounts of pharmaceuticals have become an overdose crisis. We read social scientists, journalists, public health scholars, and first-hand accounts in order to understand the chronic emergencies (such as de-industrialization and despair) behind this acute crisis. By investigating the opioid epidemic in this way, students are encouraged to think boldly and creatively beyond the traditional boundaries of medicine: perhaps someone's best medicine is a housing voucher, or a testing strip to detect fentanyl. By the end of the course, students understand the social roots of the opioid epidemic and how solutions may be implemented."

Recent advances in planetary exploration, astronomy, geochemistry, and biochemistry are leading to a revolution in our ideas on the emergence of life on our own planet and the likelihood of finding life outside the Earth. In particular, much is being learned about Mars and Venus because of the many recent and ongoing space missions. Spectacular data from Jupiter's and Saturn's moons, like Titan, Europa, and Enceladus, show that these moons may become possible targets of future searches for life in our solar system. Geochemists are finding more and more intriguing clues about the Earth's past by analyzing rocks dating from the very first period after the Earth's formation, thus providing a fundamentally new context for research on the transition between chemistry and primordial life. And astronomers have been recently successful in searching for planets around other stars.

We also discuss the role of commensals when health is perturbed during conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and infection. Students learn what changes in the commensal communities co-occur with the different diseased states. Under the commensal-neurodegenerative disease topic, we explore the contribution of commensal-derived metabolites to the development and progression of autism, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's diseases. Under the commensal-cancer topic, we examine how the efficacy of current biologics for cancer treatment depends on commensal colonizers. Lastly, we explore how commensal species alter immune responses to determine susceptibility to infections.

Students develop a solid understanding of innate versus adaptive immunity; antigens and antibodies; B cells, T cells, and their receptors; major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins; cytokines and chemokines; processes of lymphocyte development and antigen presentation; and the genetics of the immune system. Case studies describe clinical aspects of human immune system function in health and disease including infections (bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic), cancers, autoimmune diseases, allergic and other hypersensitivity diseases, immunodeficiencies, transplantations, vaccinations, and medications and other therapeutic agents (including biologics and CAR-T cells) that affect and harness the immune system. Along the way, we touch on broader themes such as the relationship between the immune system and the nervous system, the dynamics of complex systems that operate at different planes of resolution (from the molecular and cellular to whole populations of organisms and the interactions of different species in ecosystems including the human microbiome), and some philosophical and interpretive views of immunity such as how it contributes to identity and how it functions in ways analogous to language.

This course takes a close look at the human condition as viewed through the lens of classical Greek civilization; the basic organizing principle is an objective study of a model of humanity, the hero. Students learn that there are different definitions of the hero in different historical times and places. In the end, though, the one true hero of this course is the logos or word of logical reasoning, as activated by Socratic dialogue. The logos of dialogue in this course requires careful thinking, realized in close reading and reflective writing. The last word about this logos comes from Plato's memories of words spoken in dialogue by Socrates during the last days of his life, which is read towards the very end of the course. Such a last word, shaped by a deep understanding of the idea of the hero in all its varieties throughout the history of Greek civilization, becomes the latest word for students who earnestly engage in dialogue, by way of writing as well as reading, with heroic expressions of the human condition. This course is driven by a sequence of dialogues that lead to such an engagement, guiding the attentive reader through many of the major works of the ancient Greek classics. In this course, all readings (which are freely available via the course website) are translated into contemporary English and supplemented by selections from the ancient visual arts."

Course work for individual students culminates in a major writing project in the student's chosen genre (for example, a play, screenplay, piece of short fiction, or piece of long fiction).

More specifically, the course is based on a simple premise: good readers make good writers. Reading and discussing texts by the likes of Zadie Smith, James Baldwin, and Joan Didion help students become both as they hone their knowledge and appreciation for the craft of writing. We also attend to such topics as persona and point of view, the relationship between concision and coherence, and various strategies for pre-writing, drafting, revising, and editing. These conversations carry over to workshop, as well as the two different essays (and a final portfolio) that students submit by the end of term."

Many writers are drawn to the page by character or language or theme, but story is the scaffold on which movies and novels depend. Over the course of the semester, we learn to work creatively with the tasks of story building. We begin with ideas where and how do we find them? What kinds of ideas can carry a story? How can you turn a wobbly idea into one that works? We then consider character who does the story belong to? How do their desires, problems, and drives give the story its essential energy? Then we turn to story development and structure, the primary work of the course: how do you keep an idea alive for two-hundred pages, or two hours? What elements help a story build energy and momentum, and deliver us to a satisfying close? We explore these essential story energies using writing exercises, examples from film and literature, and the shared experience of working writers."

The analytic platforms need to match this pace of generated data, digest it, and generate useful insights. The best decisions are made with informed data and as it changes, one needs to follow the signals and indicators embedded in the data. The technology space is evolving rapidly and choosing the right technology fit for the data at hand is an important decision. The next decision is to select the best architecture to provide the solution for technical challenges and helps the business improve its growth, revenue, and time to market. Spark provides a swiss army knife to handle the entire data life cycle, from ingestion to consumption. Newer offerings from the open source community around Delta and MLFlow help strengthen the data platform by making it performant, reliable, and repeatable. Often, innovation is left in proof of concept stages and does not see production because of the lack of foundational architectural components necessary for hardened and mature enterprise-grade deployments. This lost innovation translates to lost revenue and missed opportunities. This course helps students to appreciate the power of technology and skillfully apply it in practical situations in the real world. It leverages the Databricks platform on Amazon web services (AWS) to simplify the cluster setup so that students can focus on the data engineering aspects of getting the data ready for analytics.<br><br>Prerequisites: Familiarity with Amazon Web Services, structured query language (SQL), and Python.

We investigate topics such as large language models (LLMs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and differentiable applications in natural science. For important classes of neural networks, we explore the fundamental mechanisms behind their operations and provide practical illustrations of their uses. For example, we review the structure of transformer-based pretrained LLMs, the principles of attention, and their use in applications such as ChatGPT, with a focus on understanding prompt programming. For GANs, we examine the generation of realistic representations of people, speech, paintings, and music. For GNNs, we dive into the analysis of chemical molecules, proteins, and drugs and quantitative structure property relationship in physical systems. We learn how to impose constraints that are reflections of physical or geometric laws governing physical systems. Concepts introduced in every lecture are illustrated by practical examples.

How is this possible? More computing power? Intensive application-specific engineering? While these certainly have had a role to play, in this course, students are exposed to and learn how to use general algorithm design principles that cut across application domains and remain relevant even as computing technology changes. First among these principles is mathematical abstraction, whereby we capture the essence of a computational problem (as well as the notion of what a computer is) so that we can develop and analyze solutions independent of an implementation. Given these mathematical abstractions, we can apply a toolkit of basic algorithmic techniques in the search for solutions and then gain certainty in their correctness and efficiency through rigorous mathematical proofs. Furthermore, the powerful concept of reductions allows us to identify relationships between computational problems that seem very different on the surface and thus automatically transfer solutions from one to another. At the same time, some important computational problems have defied the search for algorithmic solutions. Computer scientists would love to have debugging tools that determine whether their programs can crash, natural scientists would love to have simulators that quickly determine the energy-minimizing states of physical or biological systems, and university registrars would love to be able to automatically schedule classes in a way that optimally maximizes the use of the best classrooms. Why have no scalable algorithms been found for these problems? In the last part of the course, students learn that many important computational problems are inherently unsolvable they have no general algorithmic solution whatsoever. Others are solvable, but have no efficient algorithm the minimum computation time inherently grows exponentially with the size of the problem instance. Uncovering these phenomena (known as uncomputability and intractability, respectively) are unique benefits of a mathematically rigorous approach to algorithms. While we may sometimes be satisfied with empirical demonstrations of the performance of an algorithm we have found, a proof seems to be the only way to convince ourselves that there is no algorithm whatsoever. This course aims to give students the power of using mathematical abstraction and rigorous proof to understand computation. Thus equipped, students are able to design and use algorithms that apply to a wide variety of computational problems with confidence about their correctness and efficiency, as well as recognize when a problem may have no algorithmic solution. At the same time, students may gain an appreciation for the beautiful mathematical theory of computation that is independent of (indeed, predates) the technology on which it is implemented.<br><br>Prerequisites: Experience with proofs and discrete mathematics at the level of CSCI E-20, and (Python) programming at the level of CSCI E-50."

In a little over ten years, deep learning algorithms have revolutionized several aspects of computer vison. Applications that were infeasible or impractical a few years ago are now in routine production. These advances allow intelligent systems to interact with the real-world using vision. Examples of modern computer vision (CV) applications include digital photography, robotic or autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and scientific imaging. This course is a fast-moving survey of both fundamental theory of CV algorithms along with hands-on practical assignments applying these methods using Python. Successfully deploying CV applications often requires a combination of classical methods and state-of-the-art algorithms. Therefore, this course includes classical image processing and CV techniques which are the basis of many standard CV applications. From this foundation the course moves to the deep learning approaches that have revolutionized computer vision. Students apply tools drawn from the extensive universe of Python CV related packages in the hands-on assignments. Major topics covered in the course include: algorithms used to prepare images, transform images and extract features; statistical properties of images and methods of decomposition; classification of objects in images; optimization and regularization for machine learning algorithms; deep neural networks for image classification; motion in images and optical flow; advanced deep neural network architectures; object detection and tracking algorithms; models of stereo vision; segmentation of images; and generative models.<br><br>Prerequisites: Experience programming using the Python language, equivalent to CSCI E-7 or CSCI E-29.

We start by learning about basic programming paradigms such as data types, variables, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and more. Next, we apply these concepts to build simple web applications that involve form processing and basic database interaction. In addition to coding, students are also introduced to universal programming tools such as command line, Git version control, server management, and software testing. Emphasis is also placed on troubleshooting strategies and technical communication. While we primarily work with PHP, we address how the concepts we are working with apply to other web-capable programming languages. Additionally, we take a broad look at numerous tools and frameworks used on the web and learn about when and how each tool is most appropriate.

We read as practitioners, reflecting on how various ideas might apply (or not apply) to designs we create and seeking inspiration in a wide variety of places. To help us envision the scope of design possibilities and to prepare for an unknowable future of online learning, we practice brainstorming multiple solutions to common design challenges. Over the course of the semester, students create an online learning project of their choice, which we collectively workshop and learn from. Students walk away with a project they can actually use or can showcase to potential employers. Among the topics we address are working with instructors and subject matter experts to identify and design to the heart of a course, enhancing student community, translation of face-to-face experiences, selecting online technologies, assignment and assessment design, working with artificial intelligence (AI), and evaluation of learning design success.

The focus is on scene and monologue work and audition techniques. The texts for the scenes and monologues come from contemporary theater, television, and film scripts. Core components of the course include the idea of simply working from yourself, action-based acting (how one person is trying to change/affect another person in a scene), how to read a scene or monologue to figure out what your character might want from that situation, how to find a personal connection to that character, and how to choose material that best suits the individual actor for auditions and scene work. The course is designed around tangible and concrete ideas and techniques, so that those who might initially be intimidated by the idea of an acting course, or an arts course in general, feel comfortable. It is important to note that while the course is intentionally designed to be as un-intimidating and accessible as possible, it does require a good deal of work outside of class time.<br><br>Prerequisites: Audition.

The focus is on understanding the way the economy works in the real world in contrast to conventional economics, which relies excessively on assumptions, theorizing, and abstract models of the economy. We apply the concepts we learn to contemporary controversial topics such as minimum wage legislation, the function of unions, and why the free market overcharges for healthcare. We explore why Noble Prize-winning economists such as Paul Krugman and Joe Stiglitz are so critical of the current economic situation for its dizzying inequality, its endemic underemployment, humongous trade and government deficits, stagnating wages, and lack of inclusive growth that is unable to provide a dignified life for so many millions of its citizens. Mainstream economists do not have the answers to the challenges of globalization, inequality, and technological unemployment because they are unable to think creatively about new institutional structures that would enable us to transition to a full-employment, high quality-of-life economy in which the focus is not on production and consumption, but the achievement of a high quality of life. In contrast, this course weaves ideas from history, psychology, sociology, and political science into a common-sense economic perspective in order to explore these issues. We also discuss the achievements of Nobel Prize-winning behavioral economists and the impact of the financial crisis of 2008, the economic roots of the rise of populism, and the main impact of the COVID-19 pandemic."

Economics is not primarily a set of answers, but rather a method of reasoning. By the end of the semester, students are able to use the analysis practiced in the course to form their own judgments about many of the major economic problems faced by the United States and other countries. In the first part of the semester, we focus on microeconomics, which is the study of the interaction of people and firms in markets. Since we live in a market economy, this study helps students to understand how American society organizes its economic affairs. We examine how the forces of supply and demand operate in the markets for goods and services. Students learn powerful tools that enable them to understand a great deal about the economy and how it works. Using these tools, we develop a framework to evaluate social policies. Trade always a controversial subject is analyzed, along with measures, such as tariffs, designed to restrict trade. Theories concerning firm behavior are then examined how companies decide how much to produce, and the profits which result. During the second half of the semester, we focus on macroeconomics, the study of the economy as a whole. We study economic growth and development, business cycles, and the impact of both monetary and fiscal policy on inflation, unemployment, interest rates, investment, the exchange rate, and international trade.

When the Fed or the European Central Bank announces a monthly $85 billion securities buying program, how exactly does this money flow through the markets? When the government bails out a major bank, how does this action affect the bank, its competitors, the markets, future perceptions, and the economy at large? How can central banks affect the economy in an environment of zero and even negative interest rates? Should regulation influence the behavior of firms or individuals? Using the 2008 financial crisis and policy responses thereto as a backdrop, we explore how (and whether) the new capital markets created over the past thirty years as a result of greatly increased financial innovation, globalization, and communication are distorting the economic effect of traditional government monetary and/or fiscal influence. The role of important constituents (commercial and investment banks, exchanges, regulators, hedge funds, and government interventions) are reviewed and evaluated for both past performance and future relevance. The course addresses important current topics in both economics and public policy, such as too big to fail, moral hazard, globalization of markets, currency unions, liquidity traps, efficiency of markets, the role of credit rating agencies, shadow banking, regulation of derivatives and hedge funds, Glass-Steagall, and the Volcker Rule. Following deliberations and analysis of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, we then examine the monetary and fiscal policy responses to the pandemic crisis of 2020-2022. Were these policy responses even more extreme? Did central banks overshoot? Were lessons learned from the financial crisis?

We ascertain recurring historical patterns of financial bubbles without, however, overlooking critical differences. If history repeats itself, why can't we avoid making the same mistakes repeatedly? The great meltdown happened at a time when most mainstream macroeconomists (including the former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke) were writing about how great everything was going since business cycles had vanished for all practical purposes. They were obviously dead wrong. The historical evidence enables us to gain a more thorough understanding of global finance, which influences our lives to such a great extent. Our primary aim is not to concentrate on facts, theorems, or numbers, but rather to see the big picture in a multi-disciplinary and long-run perspective, integrating the knowledge gained from the work of such Nobel Prize-winning behavioral economists as Robert Shiller and Daniel Kahneman. We also explore our current economic situation, including the aftermath of the Wall Street bailouts that forgot to bail out the people on main street and stood by as nine million people were evicted from their homes. We also discuss the aftermath of the crisis, its effect on the rise of populism, and end by outlining the main impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial world."

Unsurprisingly, this has led to renewed interest in using games for educational purposes, with various stakeholders in a variety of contexts contributing to the discourse. Educational technology companies and learning and development departments within organizations are particularly influential, armed with newly coined yet somewhat nebulous buzzwords such as gamification. At the same time, there has been a constellation of new and emerging technologies that are not only transforming our understanding of what it means to learn, but also disrupting traditional notions of work. These changes are all further complicated by new and potentially dangerous methods of data capture that influence design decisions to prioritize financial gain over the needs and well being of learners. However, the main puzzle is that while modern schooling has only existed for a few hundred years and various forms of digital edutainment for even less, games and play have served as natural, powerful, and intrinsically motivating learning vehicles for thousands of years. In this project and problem-based course, we strive to resolve these various tensions by viewing games and play as natural literacies that coexist and cooperate within a complex, interconnected ecosystem. We critically evaluate traditional ideas of learning, wrestle with the outlandish claims of companies, and explore alternative pedagogies and their associated measurement methods. While this course draws on foundational research in the learning sciences, we are less interested in debating the particulars of these findings and more interested in distilling and creatively translating them into playful tools for thinking, discovery, reflection, and expression."

We read such poets as Robert Frost, T.S. Eliot, Marianne Moore, Langston Hughes, William Carlos Williams, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Claude McKay, Dorothy Parker, and Wallace Stevens.

Love and work involve choice on the part of the beloved and the worker, and by those bestowing the sought for love and work. The choice almost always involves assessment of the person's identity, which is often defined by terms thought to indicate essential characteristics. These terms have often included the person's race, ethnicity, gender, religion, and language. Differences in these terms between those choosing and those hoping to be chosen can mean inclusion or rejection in the flourishing offered by love and work. The stakes can be as high as life and death when difference plays into a person's trying to become what they are through love and work. The novels in this course Joseph Conrad's Lord Jim, Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God, Janet Frame's Owls Do Cry, and David Leavitt's The Lost Language of Cranes range across the twentieth century from the late Victorian era to the 1990s and are set in Africa, New Zealand, the rural American South, and New York City.

From civil disobedience to heresy, from abolitionism to utopianism, this course explores how transcendentalism takes root in New England to generate some of the most radical experiments in Antebellum America life. However, regardless of transcendentalism's fame, or how illustrious its members, or how canonical its texts, we have no satisfactory way to define the movement or its achievements. What does it even mean to transcend? Transcend what and to where? In this course, we attempt to figure out what transcendentalism is and why it matters by traversing its theological, historical, and literary contexts. Tracing (or perhaps dissolving) the boundary between human, world, and god, we investigate how intellectual and social revolution happens without distinguishing poetry from science, religion from politics, accident from fate, and perhaps even transcendence from immanence.

And how can writing it help usher in the future we want? In this course, we explore these and other questions by considering the evolving literature of American higher education over the last half century.

This course explores the legal framework in which climate change mitigation and adaptation actions occur and the policy tools available to regulators. We explore several climate change mitigation and adaptation measures in-depth to provide a window into the relationship between legal and policy strategies at the federal, state, and municipal levels, including how these relationships create opportunities and obstacles to climate change action. Students strategize how to develop and implement legally defensible climate change measures that are supported by stakeholders, including drafting implementation and supporting documents. The course begins with a brief introduction to climate change and its projected impacts and then reviews the legal framework of climate change law, including the evolution of climate change related laws in the United States and related litigation. This analysis focuses on the federal level, but also considers the separate authority of states and municipalities to take action. Massachusetts and Boston are the primary case studies for the course. Substantive issues that are addressed include administrative law and the relationship between congressional statutes and agency regulations; the structure of the federal Clean Air Act and history of air regulation in the United States; federalism, particularly the relationship between federal, state, and municipal governments in regulating air pollution; and the judicial review processes. The course applies this legal framework to an in-depth review of specific climate change issues, such as strategies for managing development in flood-prone areas. In this context, the course examines a range of legal and policy tools. At the federal level, for instance, we consider the implications of federal maps that designate flood risk areas without considering projected impacts of climate change and incentives created by federally-subsidized flood insurance. The course then considers strategies for improving regulation and removing obstacles to climate change measures, including through state and local actions, such as revised building codes and zoning laws. We review the process that municipalities often follow in climate change planning, with a focus on the technical and legal challenges that communities need help addressing. Through this analysis students learn about substantive legal issues such as preemption and takings law, procedural aspects of rulemakings, and opportunities for public involvement in policy and regulatory development. In addition to learning about the substantive legal issues covered in the course, students develop or practice legal research skills associated with researching statutes and regulations and interpreting judicial decisions. Students also gain experience with activities relevant to designing and implementing climate change strategies by writing comments on regulations, drafting statutory or regulatory language, and writing corporate climate change statements."

These emissions include all indirect GHG emissions that occur in a value chain and therefore outside the direct control of a typical organization. Supply chain emissions are frequently the largest overall source of an organization's GHG emissions and are becoming an increasingly relevant topic as more companies outsource manufacturing, logistics, and other key functions to third parties. Waste, water use, and GHG emissions are still incurred in bringing products and services to consumers, but they are often not fully accounted for. Proper accounting for these emissions that are known contributors to climate change is coming under increasing scrutiny through major disclosure initiatives including the US Securities and Exchange Committee (SEC) and European commissions such as the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG). Students investigate how to gather data from disparate sources, how to calculate or estimate emissions, and how the procurement of supplies, services, and travel can be managed to mitigate or even reduce indirect emissions. The course also familiarizes students with leading measurement and goal setting standards (the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, the Climate Registry, Science Based Targets, and the Carbon Disclosure Project or CDP) and investigates indirect emissions reduction efforts that are underway at several leading Fortune 500 companies as well as universities, municipalities, and government agencies.<br><br>Prerequisites: ENVR E-116 is encouraged but not necessary."

In 2019, the T T sector contributed 10.3 percent to global gross domestic product (GDP), over US $8.9 trillion, supporting one in ten jobs (330 million) worldwide, and one in five new jobs over the last five years. However, the health and economic crises of the pandemic threw the disruptive forces acting on T T into sharp relief, drawing attention to the interconnected and hyper-dependent nature of sustainability, health, and business. For many countries, T T is the dominant sector generating income, tax revenues, and economic security for millions of individuals and their families. However, it is clear that the negative impacts of T T on people and the planet cannot be allowed to continue as the sector recovers it needs to build back better and more sustainably. Positioning sustainability as a strategic driver, many T T companies are showing the enormous potential the sector has to drive fulfilment of the United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs). This course presents innovative case studies and expert speakers from across the sector and challenges students to surface the tensions and choices inherent in driving growth and recognize the technical, economic, and political dimension in scaling sustainability solutions. It widens the view of sustainability beyond immediate operational impacts to consider the broader systems in which T T operates and the sustainability leadership practices that drive innovation. It pays attention to the trade-offs and dilemmas presented by T T activities and the enormous potential of the sector to educate the traveler and drive conservation. This course encourages student to re-imagine the sector and pursue more sustainable T T, focused on attenuating its negative impacts and advancing the contribution T T makes to global citizenship and a more balanced economy and equitable society."

However, urban life is currently far from sustainable due to inequality, poverty, poor air quality, high risk of natural disasters and climate change, and lack of access to energy, water, and waste treatment. Faced with these challenges, member countries of the United Nations adopted in 2015 an agenda for 2030, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), with one of these goals focused on ""making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable."" Therefore, the future of urban societies, and thus of most of the world's population, depends on our ability to design, build, and run cities in a sustainable manner. This course aims at contributing to this goal by surveying the scientific principles of sustainability at the urban level, exploring cities and their metabolism as systems of systems. It covers the main challenges that cities of every size are facing: governance, inclusive urban economic development, national/regional development planning, safety, citizen participation, risk and vulnerability reduction, air quality, resource efficiency, and access to universal basic services, housing, and infrastructures. By paying attention to the contextual factors in which these challenges play out for different types of cities, students not only gain a general understanding of the key dimensions of urban sustainability, but they also learn fundamental governance aspects in cities, such as the need to create partnerships and establish radical collaborations between diverse stakeholders to foster urban transformations."

Agriculture is also tied to ecological degradation including deforestation, depletion and contamination of water and soil resources, and chemical pollution. However, many individuals and organizations are discovering innovative and tailored solutions to these problems. Addressing the ecological and climate change challenges of agriculture in the next ten years will be essential to ensure a meaningful reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and to creating resilient production systems.

The United Nations has stated that if soil degradation continues, we may only have 60 years of farming left. Loss of topsoil through agricultural practices is a major contributor to water and air quality degradation and biodiversity loss. Replenishing degraded soils may be a critical element in battling burgeoning health crises such as micronutrient deficiencies, obesity, and related diseases. Increasing soil health will also be a critical response to combating and adapting to the climate crisis. Though strong market, political, and social forces perpetuate the status quo, policymakers, agricultural producers, and the general public are taking note and developing, examining, and implementing a wide array of interventions to reverse soil degradation. This course explores the global food system from food production to disposal from the premise that agricultural soil health must underlie any sustainable food system that supports public and planetary health and social equity. We address the current state of agricultural soil health globally and the current and future effects on public and planetary health, including effects on water, air, climate, and nutrition, and social and economic equity. We explore whether adopting sustainable agricultural practices that support and enhance soil health can feed the growing global population while simultaneously buttressing achievement of the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Finally, we examine the key interventions put forth to support agricultural soil health, including direct farmer education and subsidies, social movements such as food sovereignty, labeling requirements, corporate initiatives, consumer education, and increased organic waste recycling."

This course takes lessons from the theories and practices of sustainable investment in the professional investment industry and makes them accessible to other disciplines. In every sector and situation, one is increasingly expected to identify, measure, and report material environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks. Every investment has implicit ESG factors, because every decision made relies upon humans to buy, make, or do something and employs the rule of law to govern contractual relationships between investor and investee. Investment decisions are made daily for more than US $100 trillion assets under management in the global investment industry and projected to grow to US $145.4 trillion by 2025. This course explores capital allocation decisions more broadly, looking at decisions made every day by governments, companies, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Sustainable investment proactively considers themes and issues such as climate pollution, workplace safety, employee health and wellness, local community relationships, diversity, executive compensation, business ethics, corruption, and new market innovation. We explore critiques of sustainable investment to better understand theory and practice. While some have tried to tarnish what ESG is, and is not, the reality is every investment, business or government today is fast learning how best to integrate all factors, including ESG factors, into their investment decision-making practice. In a multi-polar world with interconnected decision-making processes and consequences, more stakeholders demand greater transparency, customers have expectations of their vendors, reputation and litigation risks are profligate, and regulators seek to reduce negative impacts on society. This course is grounded in industry experience, investment policies and portfolios, and cross-disciplinary academic literature. We teach using Harvard Business School case studies and case examples drawn from industry. The course blends the academic and practitioner literature with current academic research and industry activities to ensure students learn from the most relevant material.

This course adopts an unusual, holistic approach by embedding understanding and integration of these principles through a series of ecosystem case studies focused on desert, savanna, and mountain ecosystems; wetlands and other aquatic systems; boreal, temperate, and tropical forests; and agroecosystems. These ecosystems and specific sites exemplify different challenges but similar ecological processes at work for successful management, whether the goal is protection of natural systems and biodiversity, ecological restoration, or maintaining ecosystem services in agricultural and other human-dominated landscapes. Through this approach, the fundamental topics covered in typical ecology courses are exemplified. The historical, evolutionary, and ecological processes determining the distribution of ecosystems, habitats, and species are introduced. Evolutionary processes responsible for the adaptations of individuals are examined to understand the diversity of species and their features. Ecological processes of competition, predation, disease, and mutualism help explain the functioning of biological communities and larger ecosystems. Among other activities, teams of students conduct background research on specific ecosystem sites to understand the ecological, economic, sociocultural, and multistakeholder context of sustainability challenges and integrated solutions."

The course focuses on sustainability opportunities and enterprises in these rural landscapes. Emphasis is on the benefits of regenerative farming and small-scale organic farm enterprises, typically with diverse production systems, common historically and now resurgent in the farm to table and local food movements as alternatives to industrial agriculture. The course focuses on comparisons between New England and Tuscany; in both of these regions, ecological and economic sustainability challenges in the rural landscape include producing food and forest products for niche markets, managing watersheds, conserving biodiversity and other environmental services, such as carbon sequestration, and diversifying income streams with ecotourism. Optimizing this mix of functions while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of pollution addresses sustainability goals. Online required class sessions discuss readings on models and analysis of sustainable food production systems, including organic, permaculture, and forest farming systems. Assignments and readings develop skills in spreadsheet modeling of production integrated with financial analysis of small-scale enterprises. The centerpiece of the course is an intensive and mandatory week long learning experience, May 5-May 12, in residence at Spannocchia, a historical Tuscan farming estate near Sienna. Field exercises and discussions at Spannocchia are augmented with an all-day field trip to a nearby biodynamic winery and onward for the afternoon to the hill town of San Gimignano, and then a half-day trip to Tenuta San Carlo in southwestern Tuscany, a very different agro-ecosystem. Students should not have other work or study commitments during this period. The course involves some hiking and fieldwork on several days over uneven ground; because these are critical course activities, students must be physically able to participate. Students are housed at Spannocchia in either the Fattoria or Villa rooms in the main building; rooms are typically shared doubles, spacious and historical. Meals feature organic products from the estate. View the Spannocchia website for photos and descriptions of accommodations, programs, and the estate property. Students with documented disabilities should contact the Accessibility Services Office no later than two weeks before the course begins.

Ecosystems tend toward a stable equilibrium, or homeostasis, and have the ability to regenerate and thrive for thousands of years. Likewise, the circular economy seeks to maintain the value and preserve the stocks of materials, components, and goods, while eliminating waste and pollution and restoring natural capital. The circular economy allows for a better economic and ecological performance than today's prevailing economy which follows a take-make-waste linear model that destroys value, depletes stocks, and degrades living systems. The transition to a circular economy is mandated by the ecological and physical boundaries of our planet. Without an accelerated transition it will be impossible to meet the Paris Agreement targets. At the same time, the transition to a circular economy is a tremendous opportunity that would unleash global economic growth and create an estimated 95 million new jobs worldwide while also boosting economic resilience. The European Union, Canada, China, and other leading economies have outlined aggressive roadmaps towards a circular economy. In the United States, 60 percent of chief executive officers plan to transition to a circular economy framework. This course challenges not only what, but how students think about sustainability. Students are encouraged to think in systems and material flows, while embracing a radical collaboration mindset. Along the way we visit different areas of opportunity that range from biomass management to industrial symbiosis; examine circularity in sectors as diverse as food, electronics, and plastics; outline the role of related disciplines such as biomimicry and permaculture; and discuss innovative business models where products are servitized, dematerialized, and completely redesigned to foster modularity, repairability, upgradeability, and cradle-to-cradle life cycles."

What are the limits of our understandings and when do we need to bring in others to develop site-specific analysis and strategies? Professionals in the sustainability and global development fields often need to work on or assess agriculture, water, and natural resource conservation projects and supply chains across different geographic, ecological, and agricultural regions. While they do not have to be experts in every situation, they do need to be able to learn quickly about complex natural systems in order to work effectively in teams, provide analysis, and make programmatic decisions. Despite the diversity of these natural systems, there are common processes and mechanisms that underpin and connect all of them. There are key questions one can ask in any situation to learn more. If professionals are familiar with these common ecological and physical processes, then they are capable of quickly adjusting their work to new contexts by asking relevant technical questions, recognizing what they do not yet know, and identifying with whom they should consult. This course is designed to cultivate critical thinking as it relates to natural resources management to help each student understand common processes across natural systems and to develop a set of questions that can guide their future work in any given location. The course covers the core characteristics and management of water, soils, forests, pastures, and agricultural systems and how they are interconnected. Specific topics include water resources, river dynamics, and how natural and human-caused ecosystem disturbance such as fire, logging, and grazing factor into the ecology and succession of forests, grasslands, agriculture, and ecological restoration.

This is an applied course that teaches the skills and intellectual frameworks necessary to effectively secure and manage public and private protected areas, a critical toolset for advancing nature-based solutions. The course includes a hands-on field component, which is customized by the instructors to each student's geography and interest, and which reinforces the practical skills and knowledge taught throughout the semester. Protecting and sensitively managing the world's lands and waters strongly influences the future richness of global biodiversity, the economic future of rural and indigenous communities, and the trajectory of future global climate change. The course covers the global origins and growth of land conservation tools and strategies and their relationship to other social movements, including climate action, democratic and multilateral institutions, and environmental justice. We use case studies from the instructors' decades of experience as conservation leaders and practitioners and a global network of guest lecturers practicing in different settings around the world to examine the advantages and limitations of a comprehensive range of land conservation tools and strategies. These include, but are not limited to, direct government action, including two national parks; private lands conservation, including conservation easements and other private lands protection agreements used around the world; strategic conservation planning, including creating ecosystem- and large landscape-scale protected areas; land conservation as part of global carbon credit and offset programs and the emergence of biodiversity credit methodologies; and the growth of community-based conservation. These tools and strategies are presented in the context of the effectiveness of nature-based solutions to advance both climate change mitigation and adaptation. The field component of the course allows students to learn through experiential work done directly with a conservation organization, improving their understanding of how conservation strategies are deployed in the field. As examples, students may develop a management plan for a public or private conservation property or assist a land trust with fulfilling its conservation easement monitoring obligations. The instructors use their worldwide network of contacts in the conservation community to identify an opportunity that matches the interest and geography of each student. The field practicum substitutes for a research paper. Students emerge from the course with the knowledge, preparation, and inspiration to become effective and influential conservation practitioners and leaders around the world."

Urban agriculture is a catch-all term that covers community gardens, vegetable plots at prisons, didactically-minded gardens in schoolyards, gardens planted illegally on vacant lots, high-tech hydroponic companies, and farmers' markets. Students develop knowledge about how these spaces differ across variables like legality, goals, and actors. Students in this course learn about how growing food in Global North cities has a long past. We debate whether urban agriculture is an excellent way for city dwellers to reduce hunger and assert their control over urban space, or whether it's just another subtle manifestation of neoliberalism. A core goal of this course, above and beyond the content, is to develop research skills in multiple disciplines that will be useful for other courses."

This course teaches skills, introduces tools, and provides experiential learning opportunities that teach change agents how to accelerate local leader development and empower community action. The course begins with an overview of theory and research on community empowerment and a review of successful sustainability initiatives. Then, utilizing an experiential act-to-learn model (rather than a traditional learn-to-act approach), students are assigned to teams and paired with external sustainability practitioners (for example, change leaders working on social justice, climate, education, infrastructure, or health initiatives). Students learn community engagement skills and praxis (creating space for reflection and collective action) with practitioners' target community beneficiaries. After engaging with beneficiaries, students provide partners with a clearer picture of the community's needs and collaborate to co-create an updated community-centric theory of change and a draft a proposed community-led project charter. Throughout the course, students learn practical skills and tools associated with community empowerment and local leadership development. Students also learn and practice reflective coaching and engage in weekly coaching sessions."

Sustainability and carbon issues affect and interact with monetary stability, industrial policy, and more; comprise different analytical foci, including human behavior, politics, and power conflicts; and operate across multiple units of analysis such as individuals, groups, organizations, states, and relationships between states. Research designs must integrate distinct components coherently and logically to adequately capture this multidimensionality. A good research project has both good ideas and good design. While good ideas can be hard to pin down, a longstanding set of rules and design principles can help us turn compelling ideas into excellent research. Good design makes ideas more accessible, persuasive, and likely to achieve their aims. This course provides students with the fundamental principles for designing research projects in the sustainability field, including how to link empirical data to concepts, concepts to theory, and theory to research strategy. This includes articulating a problem, question, or research puzzle and providing a rationale for it; reviewing the relevant literature; advancing a hypothesis or argument; constructing a theoretical framework; defining concepts, variables, and relationships; and designing a test of the hypothesis or argument. Once students learn the principles of research design, their reading and comprehension of even the densest academic writing will improve. When one knows what to expect from the research design of an article, report, or book one is better able to distinguish the argument from the evidence, the logic from the information, and the normative issues (that is, what should be done) from underlying and wider practical and theoretical implications. We explore current issues in sustainability research through a number of cases that bring the full array of research design, including cross-sectional, longitudinal, and comparative designs. The particular order in which these designs are introduced throughout the course follows a cumulative rationale (that is, starting with most descriptive designs to most deductive designs). While the methodological focus is on qualitative approaches, we also look at nested designs, deploying qualitative and quantitative analytical tools simultaneously. This involves hands-on practice. By drafting a research design for a sustainability project, justifying their strategy, and examining their work for potential flaws, students' research critical thinking improves. At the same time, students gain further insights through peer and diagnostic review processes and illustrations of common research designs in sustainability studies."

We are experiencing the stark challenge of shifting the cultural and economic drivers of unsustainable patterns of living on the land at a time of a deep ideological divide in our democratic institutions. This divide is interfering with the ability of our elected leaders to develop long-term, systemic strategies for change. On the other hand, we have a better societal understanding of the risks of failing to address the unsustainability of the ways that humans are currently living on our planet. In response, local, state, tribal, and national-level leaders are open to new policy approaches, giving rise to the opportunity for environmental professionals to participate in the development of improved systems. In this course, we explore the ways that the United States has made important progress in addressing many environmental problems through its laws and policies. However, this exploration also reveals that those solutions have tended to exist in isolation, not addressing or perhaps masking larger system declines that we can see in the form of climate change, loss of biodiversity, inequitable allocation of the benefits and burdens of environmental degradation, and permanent disruption to the ability of the land, air, and water to regenerate. The fact that these trends are not abating in response to the strategies employed over the past fifty years of the modern American environmental movement suggests a need to explore what has worked, what has not worked, and how we view our current challenges through an ecological lens in order to adjust our strategy in response to that knowledge. Students in this course explore the major areas of US environmental and natural resources law and policy, with a focus on the areas of water quality and quantity, biodiversity, hazardous waste and toxic substances, and land use. Students review examples that demonstrate the interplay of local, state, tribal, and federal governmental decision-making processes. In addition, students gain experience in reading case law, statutes, and regulations, as well as policy analyses. Finally, students are invited to bring their own personal and professional experiences to bear as we explore the importance of collaboration and interdisciplinary thinking to solve complex environmental issues."

The goal of the course is to teach students how to read, analyze, and write effectively about the law. Students also learn how to brief a case, how to read a statute, the basics of legal citation, and major schools of legal reasoning and analysis. There are many different kinds of legal writing. Any given day, an attorney may need to draft a complaint to initiate a lawsuit, an indemnity provision in a lease, an opinion letter to advise a client of the legal risks inherent in a particular course of action, or an appellate brief arguing why a judge should agree with a contested interpretation of the law. Each of these tasks requires writing that is clear, concise, and convincing. Each also requires slightly different approaches to writing. Ultimately though, whatever the task, good legal writing should never be legalese."

Yet we nevertheless find that ""alternative facts"" regularly compete on equal footing with actual facts, fake news beats out mainstream news, and expert knowledge is sidelined for gut hunches and whatever feels correct. Such is the so-called post-truth age. Can our democracy survive it? Contrary to what many may think, it is not obvious that it can. Perhaps even more surprising, if it can survive, it may only be by way of the much-maligned practice of politics.

Democracy has come to many different lands in the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries, but its record of success once there has been remarkably variable. Consequently, we ask two interrelated questions, drawing upon both theoretical literature and case studies: what conditions are propitious or deleterious for democratic consolidation? And, in the latter instance, are there ways of overcoming less than ideal starting points? Posing these questions requires distinguishing between the process of democratization and the outcome of a stable, well-functioning democratic regime. In doing so, we examine problematic cases, historic and contemporary, where democracy has survived and thrived despite the initial odds (India, Germany). We also look at democratic reversals, where hopes of competitive elections and representative governance have been thwarted (Russia). The point of doing so is to have students think critically about democratic theory and regime change in order to assess events such as the Arab Spring and evaluate what factors are unfavorable to democracy (and why), as well as whether these might be overcome through institutional design or other means."

During this period new states emerged, disappeared, and re-emerged in the region. Democratic, fascist, and communist regimes were established and dismantled. Economic systems were destroyed and rebuilt. Countries experienced wars, foreign invasions, revolutions and civil wars, state- and nation-building processes, economic and political crises, rapid social and cultural transformations, and modernization. This course examines critical periods in central and east European history and politics: the emergence and experiences of newly restored independent states in the aftermath of the First World War, the devastations of the Second World War and subsequent imposition of communist regimes, their evolution and their rapid and largely unanticipated collapse in 1989, subsequent transitions to democracy and a market economy, the accession to the European Union (EU) and the recent slowdown in economic reforms, democratic backsliding, the largely unexpected authoritarian turn in some of the new EU member states and Russian invasion of Ukraine.

According to recent projections, Africa will account for more than half of global population growth in the coming decades, doubling its current population of 1.2 billion people by the year 2050. With rapid urbanization across the continent, Africa is primed to become a key player in the global economic order and the center of the world's urban megalopolises. This course provides a comprehensive introduction to wide-ranging issues that shape contemporary politics in Africa. To understand the complexity of cultures and dynamic social structures, the nature and development of political systems on the continent, Africa's place in the geopolitical arena, and the economic prospects for individual nations and the continent as a whole, we critically explore issues related to group identity and social cohesion, examine pre-colonial structures, European colonialism and imperialism, and legacies of colonialism, and evaluate how post-colonial states have grappled with democratization, nation-building, political violence, conflict, and security issues. The following guiding questions frame our study of African politics: how has Africa been shaped by colonialism and its legacies? What factors drive economic growth and development on the continent? What accounts for the relatively high levels of political violence in some African states? What are the socioeconomic and political prospects for shaping Africa's future? To answer these questions, we examine broad patterns across the continent and consider the political, economic, and social contexts in individual countries. Key thematic areas that are the foundation for this course are pre-colonial political structures; European colonialism and imperialism; nationalism and decolonization; race and ethnic identity; gender politics in Africa; neocolonialism and African economy; ethnic conflict and violence; post-conflict reconstruction; democratization; transitional justice in Africa; Africa in the geopolitical arena; diaspora and transnational solidarity; and economic dimensions of African politics.

Government affairs both domestic and foreign are still largely the province of public agencies. Where government services are carried out by contract, as with privatization schemes, they are often implemented by large private organizations with bureaucratic forms (think of Halliburton). In economic affairs, corporations both large and small produce, invest, and consume vast shares of resources. Despite the common image of businesses as small, complex and formalized organizations still do most of the work of the contemporary economy, including finance (think of the various banks now receiving funding from the US government or being nationalized overseas), production of steel and automobiles, and software development (Apple, Microsoft, or Oracle). Billions of humans worldwide organize their faith more or less by worshipping in formally organized churches with hierarchical structures, the best example being the Roman Catholic Church. Educational institutions worldwide and at every level of training are characterized by highly formalized structures, as students at Harvard University doubtless recognize. Bureaucratic organizations are not always large organizations, but they are characterized by formalized rules and regulations, systematic record-keeping and archiving of past decisions, formalized planning for the future, hierarchies of status, defined career paths (within the organization and across organizations), a concern for organizational identity, and other features. Many of these features vary immensely across organizations and there is no single epitome of bureaucratic form. This course has several purposes: to acquaint students with different theories of organization, to learn more about governmental and military organizations in the United States (the executive branch and the American bureaucracy), and to compare different forms of bureaucracy in social, economic, governmental, and military spheres. The course focuses upon government agencies, particularly those at the federal level of government in the United States, but includes powerful lessons for other forms of organization as well. The course aims to provide students with familiarity with several different theoretical approaches and models to studying bureaucratic organizations; a sense of cutting-edge scholarship on bureaucratic politics and organizations; a sound knowledge of the broad parameters of the historical development and operation of bureaucracy in the United States, especially in the military and civilian spheres; and a theoretical and empirical understanding of selected bureaucratic organizations in the history of the United States."

The deployment of nuclear weapons by superpowers during the cold war created a system of deterrence and their potential for mass destruction remains a major concern for international security to this day. In this course, we explore the history and evolution of nuclear weapons, the strategic and political implications of nuclear deterrence, and current efforts to reduce and eliminate nuclear weapons. The course begina with a brief history of the development of nuclear weapons, including the Manhattan Project and the events leading up to their deployment during World War II. We also examine the cold war arms race, including the strategy of mutual assured destruction (MAD), and the impact of nuclear weapons on international relations. Next, we focus on the political and strategic implications of nuclear deterrence. We explore the ways in which nuclear weapons have influenced state behavior, including their role in preventing major wars between nuclear-armed states. We also examine the impact of nuclear weapons on regional and global security, including the potential for nuclear escalation and the spread of nuclear weapons to other states. The course examines in particular the evolving relation between the United States and the Russian Federation, the expanding nuclear arsenal of China, the North Korea threat, and the proliferation risks of Iran. We also discuss possible escalation risks between India and Pakistan and explore how Taiwan and Ukraine might both lead to dangerous confrontations among major nuclear players. In addition to discussing the historical and political aspects of nuclear weapons, the course also examines current efforts to reduce and eliminate them. This includes a discussion of arms control and disarmament negotiations, such as the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), as well as non-proliferation efforts aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to new states. Throughout the course, we also consider the ethical and moral dimensions of nuclear weapons, including the debate over just war theory and the humanitarian consequences of their use. This includes an examination of the arguments for and against nuclear deterrence and the role of civil society in shaping public opinion on nuclear weapons."

In this rendering, primordial hatreds are driving religious wars and civil conflict with Iran, at the heart of the so-called Shi'a crescent, and Saudi Arabia, the stalwart of true Sunni identity. However, such simplistic thinking masks over a more complex understanding of the changes occurring in today's Middle East and prevents accurately differentiating between distinct yet overlapping factors such as actual substantive theological and intellectual differences between Shi'a and Sunni Islam, state competition (that is, between Iran and Saudi Arabia), and historical legacies of empire and state building in the Middle East. This course addresses such dominant narratives and challenges conventional understandings of the interplay between religion and politics in the Middle East and how sectarianism, Shi'a Islam, and geopolitical conflict can be more properly understood from a rigorous analytical perspective and focuses on the foundations and varieties of modern Shi'a political thought; religious clerical institutions; Shi'a political parties and militias in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen; and Iran's Islamic revolution, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), and the Basij paramilitary organization."

The objective of this course is two-fold: to provide students with a theoretical grounding through which to understand the political world we inhabit, as well as to introduce the academic field of comparative politics, along with its empirical expectations and modes of argumentation."

It explores competing theoretical approaches (modernization, Marxist, social, cultural, institutionalist, and history-centered) to three major phenomena in world politics: economic development, democratization, and political order. It also explores debates about the role of political institutions, states and state-building, and civil society in shaping political outcomes. These theoretical debates are examined through an analysis of cases from across the globe, including Africa, Asia, Europe, South America, and the Middle East.

By 1900 recognition of his achievement attracted an international group of painters like douard Manet, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, John Singer Sargent, Henri Matisse, and Pablo Picasso. This interest persists among artists today, who respond now to Vel zquez in video and film, sculpture, and photography. In this development, one Vel zquez work has emerged to command sustained attention: Las Meninas. Created in 1656, it first went on public view when the Prado opened in 1819. Its size (10 1/2 by 9 feet) conveys importance, but its composition, technical virtuosity, and magisterial space give iconic grandeur. Unsurprisingly, interpretations abound. After looking at related works and details of Vel zquez's life, this course focuses on Las Meninas. Social issues around portraiture arise quickly, but issues of representation are crucial, especially now.

But during his career, Sargent created another group of important works that addressed areas other than society portraiture, which also rank as masterpieces. In fact, from the exotic charm of Fum e D'ambre Gris in 1880 to the dynamic energy of El Jaleo in 1882, the daring self-assurance of Madame X in 1884, and the performative originality of Ellen Terry as Lady Macbeth in 1889, Sargent transformed established subject areas in European painting. He then pursued this original vision in large-scale, permanent forms of expression that began with The History of Religion at the Boston Library in 1895 and continued in the twenty-foot wide World War I painting Gassed in 1919 and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts rotunda in 1921. In this course we look at these works in detail, considering both style and context, to construct a new, richer set of parameters for understanding Sargent's achievement.<br><br>Prerequisites: An introductory art history course and/or a course in European painting, sixteenth through nineteenth century, or the equivalent."

The organizing theme of this course is the cycle of progress and retrenchment, of revolutions and counter-revolutions, that has come to define American life. The course begins with enslaved people's struggles for freedom, and the white planters who created a form of representative government to maintain the institution. From there, we proceed chronologically through American history to the present, exploring changing notions of community, strategies used to gain freedom, and the range of violent responses that groups seeking liberation encountered. Our readings include a play by Suzan Lori-Parks, manifestos by white power advocates, George Schuyler's novel Black No More, essays by Toni Morrison, political speeches, and oral history interviews with formerly enslaved people and migrant workers, among many other historical and literary sources. While race has been an important element to every debate about political representation in American history, most debates represented overlapping interests of race, gender, class, and even sexuality. As such, we take up each issue throughout the semester."

Yet, the Great War, as it was called, is often overshadowed by the world war that followed. As a result, few people are aware of the Great War's significance, the legacy of which is still with us. Nor do many people know about the events of that war, such as that one of its first naval battles was fought off the coast of Chile or that the effective deployment of chlorine gas at Ypres led to the suicide of the inventor's wife in Berlin. In this course, we undertake a thematic exploration of the war and its time through feature films, primary sources, and scholarly interpretations. This course seeks to provide the means for analyzing and evaluating what one reads or sees about World War I in regard to historical accuracy and for gaining a broader understanding of different perspectives. Themes include the origins of the war, what made it a world war, the impact of war on soldiers and civilians; the home front; women in war; the war in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa; and post-war issues. Films include All Quiet on the Western Front, The Big Parade, Dr. Zhivago, A Farewell to Arms, Mare Nostrum, and Le Grande Illusion."

For as long as we humans have ventured into the ocean, our imaginations have conjured images of serpents, krakens, leviathans, and other creatures, all of whom seem bent on the destruction of those who dare set foot into the sea. Humankind's conviction that sea monsters are real is so powerful that even today rumors abound of sea monsters lurking in the depths. Indeed, every major religion eastern and western features sea monsters. Are these declarations true? Do giants roam the deep sea? Did the explorers of centuries ago see creatures from their small wooden boats that we do not see today? During this course we explore sea monsters through a social, spiritual, literary, and scientific lens. We study the sea monsters that flourish on ancient maps to understand the minds of sixteenth century scholars. We examine the bodies of real sea monsters, and consider the world in which such grotesque creatures might evolve. We read tales of creatures from classic and contemporary literature. Most importantly, we develop a better understanding of how humans perceive the world, and how our consciousness can simultaneously embrace our wildest dreams and cower from our greatest fears. Sea monsters, both real and imagined, tell us much about life in the deep sea, and even more about humankind."

We are also likely to be called on to provide care for others, whether loved ones or acquaintances, or, for those in the health professions, strangers. How can we best prepare ourselves to be effective partners, whether we are the caregivers or care recipients? Or both at the same time? Engaging with a diverse range of memoirs, creative nonfiction, life writing, and novels from four continents by physicians, patients (including physician-patients), and concerned individuals, this course helps students interrogate what it means to promote healing and well being in their personal and professional lives. Readings by creative writers, activists, intellectuals, and medical professionals help us think about how we can more effectively address health crises such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease, and how we can better confront end-of-life decisions and care, including the controversies surrounding physician-assisted dying. Through narratives such as Paul Kalanithi's When Breath Becomes Air, Harriet Washington's Medical Apartheid, Anne Fadiman's When the Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down, Meri Nana-Ama Danquah's Willow Weep for Me, and Yan Lianke's Dream of Ding Village, we reflect on different ways in which to become a strong advocate for practices and policies that reduce suffering and promote healing.

In this course, we delve into the science and art of poetic expression, reception, and interpretation, drawing on insights from literary and cultural studies, neuroscience, philosophy, linguistics, new media and technologies, and psychology. We explore the ways in which poetry engages our senses, imagination, cognition, and behavior. Furthermore, as we delve into the fascinating world of poetry, we also contemplate the exciting possibilities that the future may hold. Considering the advancements in brain technologies, we explore how poetry could potentially pave the way for an entirely new art form, one that emerges from the reactions of our brains to language and engages us in a virtual reality of creative expression like never before imagined."

Kahlo lived at a time when Soviet politics and French surrealism merged with national agendas that sought to redefine Mexico's identity through the integration of their indigenous heritage. The result was a time of booming creativity in the arts, radical expansion of educational and political agendas, as well as a redefinition of women's identity, sexuality, and the Mexican family. We trace Kahlo's romantic and artistic relationship with Diego Rivera as we learn about the Mexican muralism and graphic arts traditions along with the beauty of Mexican music and popular culture. We also become familiar with the works of some of Kahlo's female artist friends, such as Lola lvarez Bravo, Tina Moditti, Aurora Reyes and Mar a Izquierdo, who gave voice to the voiceless: women, indigenous communities, and the disabled. Finally, we explore topics of Kahlo's representations in media, the commodification of her persona, and how and why she has become a global icon."

But humanity's most pressing challenges are interconnected and embroil competing interests, thus creating intractable complex systems challenges. These challenges defy simplification. Over the years, reductionist approaches focusing on linear relations failed to provide mitigations for these challenges. Attempts to address these complex challenges must employ integrative logic of systems-oriented thinking. Depth must be balanced with breadth. The goal of this course is to give students an appreciation for the complexity of some of today's most intractable problems, and in so doing, help students understand global challenges and develop methodologies for navigating the world they face. In addition, students are able to think critically on the nature of the challenges faced and propose systems mitigations that may help humanity. This multidisciplinary course is designed to be accessible to students of different backgrounds without mathematical preparations. Students learn foundations and techniques such as complexity, systems maps, design, foresights, and creating human collations. Some pressing challenges such as sustainability, climate change, epidemics, inequality, sociability, human displacement, and the critical materials for civilization are discussed. Through such topics, students critically examine trends and news and participate in discussions that could possibly influence the future of the human race. Students form small networks and groups and use different techniques to propose future-oriented analysis. They practice developing robust frameworks for integrating economic, political, technical, ethical, and social lenses into an analysis of complex problems which would reveal possible unintended consequences and roadblocks that may impede progress."

We also examine the constitutional basis for governmental regulation of broadcast content, and the interplay (or tension) between cyberspace and freedom of the press (for example, the 2011 Wikileaks controversy)."

Second Amendment jurisprudence, which was almost nonexistent until the twenty-first century, evolved rapidly after the landmark Supreme Court cases of Heller and McDonald in 2008 and 2009. These cases affirmed the constitutional right to private firearms and extended that right to constrain state action. But Second Amendment jurisprudence was thrown into chaos in 2022, with the decision of New York State Rifle Association versus Bruen, which threw all existing gun laws into serious question. This course examines the historical and continuing development of the constitutional right to keep and bear arms, the intricacies of state firearms laws and regulations, the ever-present policy issues that surround gun control and public safety and public health, and the potential future of firearms law in the United States.<br><br>Prerequisites: Basic understanding of the American legal system is preferred, but not required."

Students also gain experience in presenting shark tank and more formal pitches that incorporate references to the IP holdings of start-ups or small businesses. Further, students receive an introduction to the basics of contract instruments which allow for sharing of IP with entities outside of a start-up while protecting the IP of the start-up. Lastly, students are exposed to the IP litigation landscape that start-ups face using actual litigation matters. For example, students are provided with an overview of discovery and gain deposition skills through a hands-on approach. Upon completing the course, students are able to perform basic legal research, understand basic case law, and interpret basic legal documents, such as patent applications and simple confidentiality agreements, which are relevant to start-ups during their funding and growth periods."

The course deconstructs basic math concepts that many people often take for granted, but yet which can continue to give students difficulties throughout their school years. The course emphasizes mathematical reasoning rather than memorizing facts and formulas. In addition to the mathematical content, we also discuss how different methods of teaching affect students differently and we explore a variety of activities and games that teachers can bring to their own classrooms to enhance their students' understanding and enjoyment of mathematics. <br><br>Prerequisites: Familiarity with K-12 mathematics."

Business strategies have to be sensitive to their specific ecosystem and should be tailor-made. Mergers and acquisitions (M As) are a specific approach to leverage growth and value by redesigning corporate portfolios or by creating a competitive advantage at the business unit level. The dark side of these strategies is that they have significant risk profiles, and they tend to under-deliver on promised synergies and may seriously diminish shareholder value.

They are also one of the fastest growing and least understood areas in the asset management industry. What exactly are hedge funds? How has the sector developed? What do hedge fund managers strive to capture and how do they do it? What are the major hedge fund strategies and their mechanics? What are their hidden risks and unique limitations? How important are hedge funds to investors, regulators, and the public? From both a theoretical and practical perspective, this course is geared to help answer these questions. It surveys the hedge fund industry from its origins in the 1940s and explores hedge fund strategies including long/short, event-driven, market neutral, relative value, dedicated short-bias, convertible arbitrage, emerging markets, fixed income arbitrage, global macro, managed futures, and multi-sector investing. Students develop an understanding of how hedge fund managers as well as hedge fund investors think, operate, and invest.

This approach to understanding what it means to adapt and to remain flexible extends to almost every profession. To a future practitioner it's creating a mindset that supports diversity of viewpoints by remaining open to new ways of thinking in order to facilitate creativity and innovation. From a macro-perspective, students are made aware of alternative ways of framing change initiatives either as incremental or transformational events within an organization. From this viewpoint they are then able to search for appropriate strategies designed to optimize present and future resources. Over the years management theory has evolved from adopting best practices as a prescriptive approach to solving problems to one that incorporates the latest research in mindfulness as a method for slowing down the process, creating a brief moment of stability, deconstructing the issues, and generating multiple alternatives that address present concerns.

We all know that the works of great creative writers and the films of outstanding directors present us with the most subtle, complex, and compelling case studies on human interactions. Through the use of a one-page paper, students build a bridge between the themes and interactions they find in these works and the actions and situations they perceive within a managerial leadership context. The result is a deeper, fresher, and more nuanced perspective on managerial leadership. Specific managerial topics that students have written on in the past include achieving life/work balance; dealing with inflexible managers; recognizing and overcoming racial, gender, and cultural biases; thinking like an entrepreneur; using effective communication strategies to resolve conflict; creating an inclusive and innovative workplace; overcoming resistance to change; thinking strategically to plan present and future initiatives; developing personal power; and carrying out fragile negotiations. Students are encouraged to share their personal management experiences as they relate to the readings. Films covered include The Aviator (Martin Scorsese), Gandhi (Richard Attenborough), Shall We Dance?

You most likely can name someone you admire, someone whose abilities you wish you had. These individuals seem to know how to turn a hopeless situation into an amazing agreement. You may think they were born that way but this is rarely true. In order to be a master negotiator, you must be a master of both the science and the art. You need to have a deep understanding of the basics as well as keen insight into when to create and when to claim value, how to structure a negotiation, and how to address barriers. You should be able to be a master architect in designing your negotiation, long before you ever get to the table. It is imperative that you understand how to bring in new elements, partners, and processes that make up your negotiation campaign. Finally, the proof of your mastery of the science and your entr e into the art is when you are faced with a truly complex situation and understand how to put the science of strategy and experience into action. Becoming a master negotiator requires a solid foundation in negotiation concepts; the ability to structure and execute complex negotiations strategically; experience, but an ongoing desire to learn and grow; expertise in set up and design, agility and flexibility; empathy, sensitivity, and creativity; multidimensional thinking and planning; crisis leadership skills; system 2 thinking; and constant mindful practice. This highly interactive course delves into the strategic system 2 thinking and planning that drive success in multiple arenas including multiparty negotiations, international coalitions, and multiphase situations. We explore impossible situations, deadlocked conflicts, and interpersonal, organizational, and international disputes and learn the skills required to address these scenarios. You develop more sophisticated negotiating skills, learn how to avoid the most serious pitfalls, and emerge prepared to conduct a wider range of complex negotiations and resolve conflicts with confidence.<br><br>Prerequisites: MGMT E-4225, or the equivalent."

Whether operating in the corporate, startup, social entrepreneurship, not-for-profit, or public sectors, organizations increasingly need people who understand the creative process; know how to manage, motivate, and engage creative professionals; and can develop an organizational culture that encourages experimentation, considers the inevitable failures as learning opportunities, and enables innovative outcomes. This course focuses on best practices in creativity and innovation, exploring the interplay between creativity, organizational processes and systems, and successful innovation. Throughout the course we explore tools and techniques for fostering individual and group creativity, management practices that foster (or inhibit) innovation, methods for developing and evaluating ideas for new products and services, the business models to execute these ideas, and principles and practices for leading innovation. Using a variety of readings, case examples, discussions, experiential exercises, and a team project, students explore and apply the principles of creativity and innovation."

After Floyd's death, several corporations made pledges to advance racial equity in this nation. However, many social justice advocates have instead questioned whether these pledges have been attained or have gone far enough. This course examines the literature and the strategies advocates have used to persuade corporations to go beyond diversity and inclusion programs and how our nation's private sector can help work towards a more fair and just society for all its citizenry. The course uses a framework that provides students with a new pathway for this nation's chief executive officers (CEOs) to lead more equitable businesses. This pathway offers a strategy to achieve a fairer country for all by having companies reimagine their actions within their four walls, in the communities where they are situated, and at the societal level. The students explore the historical context for the current inequities within the US and strategies practitioners use to persuade CEOs to adopt a racial equity framework as part of their business model. A primary focus of the course is tointroduce students to the cutting-edge practices utilized by companies that have adopted the racial equity framework."

We begin by focusing on how you can make the most of these developmental relationships when you are in the learning position (mentee, coachee, or sponsee). We address questions such as: what are the best ways to network so you can build development relationships? Once you are in a meeting with a mentor, coach, or sponsor, what are the right questions to ask them? How do you know when to start or end a developmental relationship? Then, we shift focus and learn how to be an effective mentor, coach, and sponsor to others. We discuss questions such as: how do you give good advice? How do you recognize the type of support that your mentee, coachee, or sponsee needs? How do you evaluate your performance as a mentor, coach, or sponsor? Finally, we discuss how organizational structures affect the extent to which these relationships can be successful. We answer questions such as: when do formalized mentorship or coaching programs work? How should these programs be designed to optimize outcomes? This course is designed to introduce you to different forms of and perspectives on developmental relationships so that you can understand the unique value of different types of developmental relationships in the workplace; learn how to create and make the most of developmental relationships when you are in the learning position; discover how to become a more effective leader by strengthening your mentorship, coaching, and sponsorship skills; and understand how organizational structures can affect developmental relationships within an organization."

Project managers must have the abilities and skills to simultaneously manage their teams, schedules, risks, and resources, and deliver a successful outcome and this course is designed to help students learn to do just that. The objective of the course is to learn the skills and tools of the project management discipline, with a practical, hands-on, and real-world approach. Not to be underestimated is the challenge of managing without authority, an essential skill for project managers to gain the support of resources not directly under their management control. Most organizations are matrix-led, which means that resources are shared and temporary. The project manager must be able to use resources efficiently to achieve the goals and objectives required for a successful outcome, on time, within scope, and under budget. Regardless of one's project management experience, this course is designed to bring project principles to life by practicing the skills and facilitation techniques in an online team environment.<br><br>Prerequisites: Experience working in a company or nonprofit is advisable."

While the course has its foundations in microeconomics and managerial economics, it does not impose the same restrictive assumptions, which often do not hold in the real world: the equilibrium price is not known, managers cannot be assumed to know their demand function, and companies and competitors are not as rational as the theory portrays. The course allows participants to discover how and when economic concepts can and have been successfully adapted and tailored to make better decisions at real-world companies.

While the course has its foundations in microeconomics and managerial economics, it does not impose the same restrictive assumptions, which often do not hold in the real world: the equilibrium price is not known, managers cannot be assumed to know their demand function, and companies and competitors are not as rational as the theory portrays.

By examining how objects were made, used, and collected, we explore how they open up possibilities for interpreting familiar subjects in new ways and developing exhibitions and programs that are inclusive and accessible to all. This course uses the varied collections across Harvard University to practice methods for analyzing objects, developing strategies for interpretation, and envisioning ways to incorporate them into exhibitions and programs. Prior to our on-campus weekend, we read key works of scholarship on the theories and methods of material culture, the history of museums, and interpretation strategies.

There is often a point to these choices that we can identify and sometimes have thought hard about. But is there a point to life as a whole? That is the question about the meaning of life. Though the question is notoriously hard to make precise, one way or another it has animated much literature and art, and also much philosophy. Some philosophers have provided very disheartening answers to the questions of whether life has meaning, including that life is suffering and then it ends; life is absurd and never gains any meaning; life is all about creating hell for each other and we cannot escape. But other philosophers have provided more uplifting answers. Both kinds of answers deserve serious scrutiny. Such scrutiny should be of interest to anybody who wishes to make reflection on their life as a whole part of their education. After reviewing a number of pessimistic and more optimistic approaches to the meaning of life we also turn to the subject of death. We all die eventually. We normally encounter death among family and friends before we have to deal with our own. These themes too are the subject of philosophical reflection. The course finishes with a discussion of an important set of lectures on the topics of this course by a contemporary philosopher. This course is quite wide-ranging and integrates historical figures and references to art and literature as appropriate, but its main focus is on contributions by relatively recent thinkers in the Anglo-American analytical tradition of philosophy. The methodology of this course is philosophical.

We study their creative works aesthetically and intellectually, and follow their mode of philosophical thinking closely as they develop such concepts as freedom, the absurd, revolt, justice, individual responsibility, ethics, authenticity, committed writing and action, and the appeal to the conscience. Among works to be studied by Camus are The Myth of Sisyphus, The Guest, Reflections on the Guillotine, The Plague, and The Fall; by Sartre, Existentialism is a Humanism, No Exit, Anti-Semite and Jew, and What is Literature?; and by Beauvoir, The Second Sex, The Monologue, The Ethics of Ambiguity, and The Coming of Age. Most of the works are read in their entirety, the very long ones in carefully selected excerpts. Students write one-page opinion papers to help them crystallize their thoughts and prepare for class discussion."

Shaped by evolutionary forces, human psychophysiologic, emotional, behavioral, and social performance continuously adapts to intrinsic and extrinsic stressors with the aim of improving fitness. The traditional topics are supplemented with current stress-related research in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. These core topics and processes are discussed in the broader context of (mental) health and understanding of the etiology of stress-related psychopathologies, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Contemporary findings from research studies conducted in laboratory (for example, neuroimaging), occupational and extreme (for example, spaceflight), and clinical (for example, mental health clinic) environments are discussed in the context of history, systems, and research paradigms used to study psychophysiology of stress. Theoretical concepts and research findings are evaluated relative to their utility in developing prevention and mitigation strategies for stress-related psychopathologies, and translational implementation in clinical treatments. This course may feature expert guest lecturers (occupational health experts, and NASA and Antarctic researchers) and demonstrations of state-of-the-art experimental methodologies used in psychophysiologic research on stress and resilience.<br><br>Prerequisites: An introductory-level courses in psychology and human physiology is recommended prior to taking this course."

Some of the topics we cover include the definition and measurement of creativity, the nature of the creative process, the creative personality, the role of family life and culture in creativity, the relationship of creativity to IQ, and the relationship of creativity to psychopathology."

It is a symptom of several psychiatric disorders, most notably schizophrenia. It can also be experienced temporarily under the influence of psychoactive drugs, sleep loss, or extreme stress. In this course, we discuss the symptoms and phenomenology of psychosis and how it manifests in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Students also learn about the various pathways of its development, with a focus on genetic and environmental influences, as well as possible treatment interventions. Students are challenged to confront their preexisting notions about psychosis and to develop understanding and empathy for those experiencing it.<br><br>Prerequisites: An introductory psychology course recommended."

How do these things happen? This course explores the psychological mechanisms that enable cults to form and to take things to such extremes. What do cults share with other groups (mainstream religions, nations, and everyday social interactions), and what makes them stand apart? In what ways are cults an environment in which many of our psychological tendencies (toward ingroup conformity, heuristic decision making, and rationalization) are magnified?

In addition to examining the conflicts themselves, we also explore the religious dimensions of the impacts those conflicts have on civic life in areas such as public health, education, and commerce. What roles do religions play in fostering violence and what roles do they play in promoting peace? How do religious institutions and ideologies function to support and/or thwart public health initiatives? What are the ideological justifications for functional economic policies and how do they reflect and/or challenge diverse religious values? What roles do religions play in advancing or suppressing educational opportunities and for whom? Are media representations of the religious dimensions of conflict accurate?

This course draws on trends in mindfulness and the Buddhist view of compassion in theory and practice, as well as on scientific research, to explore how compassion can be applied to clinical contexts as informed by contemplative approaches.

From medieval crusades and inquisition to contemporary terrorism and persecution, the course examines the extreme fringes of politics. It takes us from the horrors of crusades and early modern religious wars to ideological and ethnic violence, the Holocaust and post-cold war mass atrocities. Political violence in the name of race, religion, empire, class, or ethnicity and weaponization of these concepts is examined in historical and comparative perspective. Techniques of its legitimization are given particular attention, including discrimination, stereotyping, scapegoating, dehumanization, and the dissemination of fake news. As they reflect on the roots and causes of extremist politics, students are also asked to reexamine the assets and liabilities of contemporary media and democratic deficit in our world.

Though in the West, they are only partly of it, and their popular cultures are highly original blends of African, European, and Asian forms. This course examines the area as a system emerging through genocide, piracy, plantation slavery, colonialism, and globalization, from a situation of great social and cultural diversity to the present tendency toward socioeconomic and cultural convergence. Patterns of underdevelopment and government are explored through national case studies (Puerto Rico, Cuba, Jamaica, and Haiti) and selected, region-wide modern issues (hurricanes, earthquakes, and other natural disasters; migration and transnationalism; crime and drug trafficking), as are cultural adaptations through studies of Afro-Caribbean religions, folkways, and music. America's special role in the region is emphasized."

Rather than opposing biological and cultural explanations, this course lays out a framework that illuminates learning and culture within a broad evolutionary framework that permits us to explore kinship, parental love, sibling rivalry, food preferences (such as sugar and salt), incest, altruism, sex differences, social status, homicide, warfare technology, language, and religion. Using a comparative approach, we contextualize human behavior by examining both studies of non-human primates, especially chimpanzees, as well as the full breadth of human diversity, including both ethnographic and experimental data from hunter-gatherers, herders and agriculturalists, and the most unusual of all people from industrialized societies. We also consider how cultural evolution has shaped our genetic evolution, both over our species evolutionary history and in more recent millennia."

""The world is filled with people / Who have never died."" For a matter so inevitable, which the best minds of every generation have tackled, a good death seems increasingly out of reach. As modern medicine racks up victories to ensure healthier and longer lives, a quieter, darker parallel story is emerging in even our finest hospitals: people die anxious and in pain, pursuing long-shot treatments instead of comfort. Why is dying so difficult, and how can we make death a better experience for others, and ultimately ourselves? This course is split into three units. In the first, we focus on cancer, with a close reading of Paul Kalanithi's When Breath Becomes Air. In this unit, we explore notions of identity, hope, and what counts as a good outcome, especially when it is at odds with the healthcare team. In the second, we reflect on mortality, including the badness of death and how death should change the way we live, reading Atul Gawande's Being Mortal and Shelly Kagan's Death. In the final unit, we examine death and dying through case studies, including sudden death, physician aid-in-dying, suicide, and the scientific quest to evade death altogether."

Do you have a stable home and health insurance? How far away is the closest trauma center or pharmacy? Do people believe your illness is your fault, or even something you deserve? This course explores how social factors create health disparities in the United States. We gain foundational knowledge of key concepts in social medicine, including an overview of health care policy in the United States and the arguments for health as a human right. We then turn to what we can call chronic emergencies: case studies of people and communities who have been denied health care and allowed to suffer and die, because they are poor, uninsured, undocumented, or otherwise social outcasts. Our examples are drawn from across the United States, from the eviction crisis in Milwaukee, to injection drug users in San Francisco, to the people who endure gang violence in Chicago, to the suffering of Mexican migrants in California. We give significant attention to the lived experience of poverty, housing insecurity, addiction, discrimination, and violence. As we encounter these examples, we engage directly with guest speakers from the community. In the final section, we turn from studying how harm falls unevenly to considering how social determinants can be incorporated into action plans; students apply the themes and concepts from the course to explore topics of their own choosing. By the end of the course, students not only have a knowledge of concepts and case studies in social medicine, but also knowledge about how to close the gaps that we study. For premedical students, this course reviews concepts found on the psychological, social, and biological foundations of behavior section of the MCAT, including how sociocultural factors and access to resources have an impact on health."

Emphasizing health as multidimensional, contextual, and socially determined, we explore the history, principles, theories, and frameworks relevant to understanding inequities in health, as well as tools and strategies for advancing justice in health across sectors of civic and community life. We explore how inequity gets under the skin and operates on the body; discuss how racism, oppression, social stratification, and systemic advantages and disadvantages all structure and perpetuate injustice in health; how systems, institutions, and policies influence health. To understand how socio-environmental factors can create pathways to health or disparities, we explore the mechanisms by which poverty, socioeconomic status, education, housing, and the built environment create and sustain inequitable health outcomes in urban communities. Understanding the social conditions people need to be healthy, we turn our attention to approaches for advancing justice in health, with particular attention to root-cause strategies. We explore community development, capacity building, and community mobilization as strategies for building power for health. We discuss health improvement interventions and how community engagement, participatory processes, and cross-sector collaboration can help create and sustain health promoting environments."

Increasingly, it is understood that child health depends on a complex of interrelated factors. Biologic and genetic issues are very important in determining children's health status. Societal, environmental, community, and family factors also play a major role in child health outcomes. We focus on social concerns such as economic status, class, race, and ethnicity. The American Academy of Pediatrics has called out poverty and racism as actual pathogens. We explore the American healthcare system and ask why in the richest country in the world, our child health outcomes are measured near the bottom in comparison with other industrialized nations and our black infant mortality remains twice that of white infant mortality. In light of the recent experience of the COVID-19 pandemic, we pay special attention to the impact of infections on children and compare the US response with that of other countries. We also look at the history of infectious disease outbreaks and the ways that these have been controlled and ultimately prevented. Finally, the course emphasizes the importance of team approaches among people from multiple backgrounds and organizations. Increasingly, we are understanding that if the threats to child health live in the society and community, so do the answers. We discuss strength-based approaches and the shifting of power and agency to families and communities and learn how hope and accentuating the positive are new approaches that are beginning to have success in the promotion of child health.<br><br>Prerequisites: Interest in children and adolescent health and development.

The course seeks to connect to students' professional work and personal pursuits outside of their coursework. Through this course, students learn to apply the course concepts and tools to their academic and professional work, as well as to advocacy and organizing efforts they may be engaged or interested with. In the course we discuss various frameworks and systems of knowing and meaning making through the research process; how they are centered on, or the extent they intersect with the pursuit of equity and justice; and pragmatic approaches for moving from theory to practice. We discuss power and privilege in the context of research; perspectives on investigator identity and location; the promise and limitations of engaged inquiry to help advance social change; and the ethics of inquiry with historically and systemically oppressed people and communities. We explore a variety of approaches, including participatory action research (PAR), community-based participatory research (CBPR), and citizen science, and discuss how different approaches for asking questions, methods for gathering and analyzing information, and sharing knowledge can be applied within various engaged research approaches. Ultimately, we critically examine how inquiry that emphasizes equity, collaboration, and reciprocity in the uncovering, integration, application, and dissemination of knowledge can be a tool of liberation and certain methods a strategy for responding to oppression, colonization, and systems of domination."

At the present moment, however, it seems in many minds to have lost its evocative power as a collective myth. One wonders: does it still represent a principle of hope or has it become a form of cruel optimism? In a time of prolonged political crisis, this course has a pressing mission. It aims to further a dynamic understanding of American dreams (for there are many and not just one), to apprehend their complexities and contradictions, to appreciate their diverse manifestations and historical shapes, and above all to take measure of their presence and meaning in the world we now inhabit. To this end, we study the variety of ways in which feature filmmakers, both in and outside of Hollywood studios, have created designs for living, indeed the most influential and resonant incarnations of American dreams. We analyze popular narratives produced during crucial junctures in the modern history of the United States, from the Great Depression and World War II through the cold war and the McCarthy era, up to the late 1960s. We consider the wide range of functions that these productions have assumed, how they have by turns sustained and questioned the status quo. In some instances they have interrogated, revealed, and even indicted social inequity; at other times they have legitimated injustice and fostered exclusion. The course offers a representative sampling of classical Hollywood features as well as some exemplary independent American releases from 1932 to 1969, including Scarface, King Kong, It Happened One Night, Birthright, The Wizard of Oz, Imitation of Life, Casablanca, Cabin in the Sky, Mildred Pierce, The Best Years of Our Lives, Salt of the Earth, The Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Raisin in the Sun, The Manchurian Candidate, The Exiles, and Easy Rider."

These days, big-budget fantasy film releases are not just a huge commercial success, but also regularly achieve critical acclaim for their narrative sophistication, thematic complexity, emotional depth, compelling set design, and gritty realism. In short, fantasy film has become a formidable cultural force both in cinema and on television. No wonder: it is the magic. Marvelous creatures of extraordinary powers abound in this wondrous world: mermaids and monsters, heroes and henchmen, giants and goblins, faeries and fiends, trolls and scrolls, wizards and witches, gremlins and goblins, ogres and dragons, slayers and sorcerers, pixies and nixies, and curses and cures. Why does a tech-savvy and scientifically advanced society like ours revel in myths of miracles and mysteries? Why are we willing to disregard laws of rationality, science, and nature, and abandon ourselves to marvels and magic? Why do we use our high-tech gadgets and digital subscriptions to conjure up medieval and archaic settings? Why does humanity, distinguished by its logos, its language of reason, find mystical incantations so resonant? And why does a society that produces life-saving vaccines in record times, find the power of pixie dust, poisons, and potions so stirring? How are we to explain this phenomenon? In fact, why are we even willing to leave the magic and supernatural in fantasy unexplained? And is fantasy mindless escapism, or is it anchored in an earthbound reality? Is fantasy a flight of fancy, or is it firmly tethered to the ground? Does fantasy offer a respite from humanity's fundamental fears, or does it shed a light on them in order to exorcise them? How is magic so unbelievable, and yet so very real, in fantasy cinema and television? And isn't film itself ultimately a fantasy, an illusion: a trick of the eye, a trompe l'oeil? Now that fantasy film routinely spearheads both Hollywood's blockbuster releases and television successes, and has accrued an enormous and loyal fan base, the mission of this course is threefold. First, we seek to define fantasy film and identify its recurring components, narrative structure, and filmic iconography in both cinema and television. Second, we examine the ways this genre of the timeless, of the mythical, of the archetypal, in fact responds to very acute and specific social and individual needs at a given time. Third, we probe why more than any other film genre, fantasy film in all its manifestations we are studying is the most primal. We examine films including: The Wizard of Oz (1933), Lost Horizon (1937), Fantasia (1940), The Thief of Baghdad (1940), It's a Wonderful Life (1946), Alice in Wonderland (1951), Jason and the Argonauts (1963), The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985), Labyrinth (1986), Edward Scissorhands (1990), Pleasantville (1998), Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), Harry Potter: The Prisoner of Azkaban (2004), Pan's Labyrinth (2006), Game of Thrones: Winter is Coming (2011), American Gods (2017), and The Witcher (2019)."
